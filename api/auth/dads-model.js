//include db from db config !
//build getAll functionality
//build getById for callback of below
//build getByFilter for calling getById for checking existing username existy
//build create which checks for existing user, then returns that user if not existy before !
//we are only using one table, so we don't need to use a transaction here.
//it will be simple :)
